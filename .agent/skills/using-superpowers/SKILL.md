# Using Superpowers (Skills)

## The Gold Rule

**Invoke relevant skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill applies means you should invoke it.

## Process Flow

1. Receive user message.
2. Check if any skill applies.
3. If yes: Invoke Skill tool.
4. Announce: "Using [skill] to [purpose]".
5. Create TodoWrite todos for skill checklist items.
6. Follow skill exactly.
7. Respond/Act.

## Red Flags (Rationalizations)

- "This is just a simple question."
- "I need more context first."
- "I can check files quickly."
- "The skill is overkill."

## Skill Priority

1. **Process Skills First**: Brainstorming, debugging (determines HOW).
2. **Implementation Skills Second**: Frontend-design, mcp-builder (guides EXECUTION).

## Instruction vs Workflow

User instructions say **WHAT**, skills say **HOW**. Never skip workflows because the task seems simple.
