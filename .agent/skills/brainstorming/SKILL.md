# Tormenta de Ideas (Brainstorming)

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs through collaborative dialogue.

## The Process

### 1. Understanding the Idea
- Consult current project state (files, docs).
- Ask **ONE question at a time** to refine the goal.
- Preferred multiple choice or focused open questions.
- Success factors: purpose, constraints, success criteria.

### 2. Exploring Approaches
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with tradeoffs.
- Lead with a recommended option and explain "Why".

### 3. Presenting the Design
- Present in small sections (200-300 words).
- Validate each section before moving to the next.
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, errors, testing.

## Post-Design Steps

- **Documentation**: Save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.
- **Implementation**: Ask if ready to set up implementation (Worktrees + Plans).

## Key Principles

- One question at a time.
- Ruthless YAGNI.
- Propose alternatives.
- Incremental validation.
