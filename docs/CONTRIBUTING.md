First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

This project is a single Next.js app managed with **pnpm**.

1.  **Fork and Clone** the repository.
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables**:
    -   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` at the repository root.
    -   Populate with your Supabase and Google AI credentials.

4.  **Start Development Server**:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

## 🧩 Code Style & Standards

We enforce high standards to keep the codebase clean and scalable.

-   **TypeScript**: Strict mode is enabled. No `any` types unless absolutely necessary (and commented).
-   **Design Pattern**:
    -   **Backend**: Follow SOLID principles. Use Dependency Injection.
    -   **Frontend**: Use Atomic Design for components. Logic should be separated from UI via Custom Hooks.
-   **Commits**: We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
    -   `feat: add new diet generator algorithm`
    -   `fix: resolve hydration error in navbar`
    -   `docs: update architecture diagram`
